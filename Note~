viewStudentQuery.jsp

1. For adding a new student record: addStudentQuery.jsp


HTML files

addStudent.html  --> addStudentQuery.jsp (To insert a record)




FOR TRANSMISSION OF PERFORMANCE AND QUESTIONS FROM SERVER TO CLIENT

(Considering only the performance)

Create a socket that will listen to any client and will take in the parameters the client sends for querying the database
1. Create a class in the server side that contains all the fields of the performance.
2. query the database and fetch the records
3. Serialize the object that is populated by the result of the query
4. send it to the client




NOTES FOR THE FINAL SERVER UI (After discussion)

1. Give pop up after a teacher registers in the server and also when she registers for a class/subject. Do not simply give a page and go forward

4. Give logout button on each page after log in and not only in the home page.  


2. Roll and subject. create a graph with the marks obtained and the x-axis is the number of quizzes.


3. During the quiz, the teacher will get bar graphs for each question. 

Multiple choice question: Like audience polls in KBC
True and False: True and false and the number of students who have given true and who have given false
One word answer: Number of students who have answered correctly and who have answered incorrectly
