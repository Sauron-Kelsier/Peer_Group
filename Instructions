Requirements of Raeha ma'am (There were 2 more, but I have already taken care of them. Just look into these 2)


1. Roll and subject. create a graph with the marks obtained and the x-axis is the number of quizzes.


2. During the quiz, the teacher will get bar graphs for each question. 

Multiple choice question: Like audience polls in KBC
True and False: True and false and the number of students who have given true and who have given false
One word answer: Number of students who have answered correctly and who have answered incorrectly
